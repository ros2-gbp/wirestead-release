## Description

Simple async C++ communication library for Serial, TCP, UDP, and Unix Domain Sockets

`wirestead` provides a unified interface for asynchronous communication across different transports, allowing applications to switch between Serial, TCP, UDP, and UDS with minimal code changes. The public C++ API exposes builders and wrappers for all four transport families.

The project prioritizes **API clarity, predictable runtime behavior, and stability** over rapid feature expansion.

> **Security note**: transports send data in plaintext by default. TCP can do TLS in a build configured with `-DWIRESTEAD_ENABLE_TLS=ON` - server and client, with the client verifying the server; UDP, Serial and UDS cannot, and DTLS is not supported. See [Security and Threat Model](https://github.com/wirestead/wirestead/blob/main/docs/security.md) before using `wirestead` over an untrusted network.

## Feature Highlights

* **Unified transport surface**: Consistent builders and wrappers for TCP client/server, UDP, Serial, and UDS.
* **Callback-scoped data views**: Avoid unnecessary copies during callbacks, with explicit ownership-copy helpers for stored data. Each payload carries the time it arrived, so a timestamp does not have to be taken after the fact.
* **Message framing**: Line-delimited, start/end pattern, and length-prefixed framers, or your own `IFramer`.
* **Optional TLS**: TCP client and server in a build configured with `-DWIRESTEAD_ENABLE_TLS=ON`, with the client verifying the server.
* **Fluent API with CRTP Builders**: Type-safe configuration with improved method chaining.
* **Built for devices**: Serial low-latency mode and RS-485, UDP multicast, a per-channel silence age for spotting a sensor that stopped talking, and a hook for putting the io threads on a real-time policy. See [Tuning](docs/tuning.md).
* **Tested runtime behavior**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites are part of the repository and documented in `test/`.

## Requirements

* **C++20 compiler and standard library**: GCC 10+, recent Clang/libc++, or MSVC 2022 (required)
* CMake 3.12 or later for plain builds; CMake 3.21 or later for the repository presets
* Boost 1.74.0 or later, which covers the system packages on Ubuntu 22.04 (1.74), RHEL 9 (1.75) and Ubuntu 24.04 (1.83). vcpkg remains the recommended dependency supplier; CI builds against the 1.74 floor as well as current Boost.

## 📦 Installation

### vcpkg (recommended)

```bash
vcpkg install wirestead
```

For Unilink migration details and compatibility aliases, see
[Migrating from Unilink](./docs/migration-from-unilink.md).

External documentation, examples, Python bindings, and container repositories
have moved to the `wirestead` organization as `wirestead-docs`,
`wirestead-python`, `wirestead-examples`, `wirestead-benchmarks`, and
`wirestead-container`.

### Contributor Development Setup

```bash
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
cmake --preset dev-linux-x64
cmake --build --preset dev-linux-x64
```

The setup script installs Boost and spdlog through an untracked, repository-local `vcpkg/` checkout by default. Delete that directory any time to reclaim space; rerun the setup script to recreate it. Set `VCPKG_ROOT` before running the script if you want to reuse an external vcpkg checkout.
CMake remains the version gate and rejects Boost versions older than 1.74.0.
The preset-based contributor workflow uses `CMakePresets.json` schema version 3, so those `cmake --preset ...` commands require CMake 3.21+.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow: running tests, `scripts/verify.sh`, commit conventions, and PR expectations.
